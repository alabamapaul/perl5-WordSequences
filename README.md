# WordsSequences
## Overview

WordsSequences is an object oriented module for parsing a file into arbitrary
length sequences.

## Installation
Install the module and associated scripts, using the from as you would install any
perl module.

## Commands
The word_sequences.pl script provides an example of how to use the module. 

The script can be used to parse an input file and generate "words" and 
"sequences" output files for the parsed data.

By default, only unique sequences are written to the "words" and "sequences"
file, but this can be changed using the --no-unique command line option.
